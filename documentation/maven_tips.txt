Tips on building a Maven project on command line
------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites: 
	Apache Maven - https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
	
pom.xml:
	A Maven project root directory is denoted by the existence of pom.xml.
	This file instructs Maven how to build the project. Includes version
	number, dependencies, Maven project identifiers (known as Maven 
	Coordinates), Maven plugins and other build configurations.
	
Maven commands:
	mvn clean
		Deletes the ./targets directory if exists
	mvn validate
		Validates the project in preparation of the build
	mvn compile
		Compiles the includes source code
	mvn package***
		Packages the compiled code into the specified package format (i.e. .jar)
	mvn install
		Places the package into the local Maven repository (in user's home directory)
	mvn deploy
		Deploys the package to a remote distribution repository
